This project was undertaken as part of my progression through the Odin Project foundations course. 

The main objective of the task was to get comfortable with flexbox, however also required a development of my knowledge of many aspects of CSS. 

In brief, skills learned and developed here include:

- flexbox (direction, alignment, justification, nesting boxes appropriately)
- font styling (size, weight, font families, coloring, decoration)
- box styling (borders, border radius)
